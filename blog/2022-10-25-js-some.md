## Introduction

This post is about the `some()` method in JavaScript. This is the second part of the series titled [Handy JavaScript Iteration Methods](https://refine.dev/blog/javascript-slice/). 


In this post, we explore with examples what the **JavaScript some** is, how it works - with and without the `thisArg` and see the impact of modifying the caller array from inside.

We'll discuss things in quite depth, so let's start with the basics.

## What is JavaScript some method?

`Array.prototype.some()` is a JavaScript iteration method that checks whether any one element in an array satisfies a given condition. The method is called on an array of items and the condition is checked with a callback function and any necessary `thisArg` object passed to the execution context of the callback function:

```ts
// Method signature

some(callbackFn)
some(callbackFn, thisArg)
```
The first argument, `callbackFn`, is mandatory and the second argument, `thisArg`, is optional.

`callbackFn`, in turn, takes three arguments. The first is the element being traversed to, `element`, which is mandatory. The second argument is the current index, `index` and the third is `array`, the array being iterated. Both the second and third arguments are optional:

```ts
// Method signature

some(function(element){...});
some(function(element, index){...});
some(function(element, index, array){...});
```


## How `Array.prototype.some()` Works

**JavaScript some** tests whether there is one element that satisfies the condition set in the callback function, `callbackFn`. It attempts to execute the callback function once for each item in the array. If it finds one that evaluates to a truthy value for `callbackFn`, it returns with the Boolean `true`. Otherwise, it seeks to traverse to the end of the array returns `false` if all are falsy:

```ts
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const even = element => element % 2 === 0;
const isThereEvenNumber = numbers.some(even);

console.log(isThereEvenNumber); // true
```

In the chunk of code above, `even()` is our callback function, which we pass in to `some()`. Apparently, we have at least one even number in our `numbers` array. So, `some()` returns `true`.


## JavaScript `some()` With `thisArg` Argument

We can pass in the `thisArg` object to JavaScript `some()` to add it to the execution context of the callback function. Let's try doing that by making some modifications to our callback.

Instead of checking for an even number, let's say we want to generalize our callback function to check if the item is divisible by a given number. We would like our callback to be something like the below:

```ts
function divisible(element, divisor) {
  return element % divisor === 0;
};
```

However, we cannot pass `divisor` as the second argument to `divisible()`, as our callback accepts `index` and `array` as the second and third arguments, respectively. And it becomes overcrowded if we introduce a fourth with `divisor`.

We can get around this problem by passing `divisor` as a property of the `thisArg` object, the second argument to `every()`. And then access the object with `this` from inside the callback:

```ts
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

function divisible(element) {
  return element % this?.divisor === 0;
};

const isThereEvenNumber = numbers.some(divisible, { divisor: 2 });

console.log(isThereEvenNumber); // true
```

Here, we set the `thisArg` object to `{ divisor: 2 }`, which basically leads to checking if the item is even or not.

We can try other divisor options, like checking if we have a number divisible by 3 or 7. Thanks to `thisArg`, this has become very easy now:

```ts
const isThereAnyDivisibleByThree = numbers.some(divisible, { divisor: 3 });
const isThereAnyDivisibleBySeven = numbers.some(divisible, { divisor: 7 });

console.log(isThereAnyDivisibleByThree); // true
console.log(isThereAnyDivisibleBySeven); // false
```



## `some(callback, thisArg)` Doesn't Work With Arrow Functions

If we look back at the first example that involves the `even()` callback, we define it as an arrow function. And it worked.

We defined its extension, the `divisible()` function with named declaration syntax. And it worked as well.

If we declare `divisible()` as an arrow function, we run into problems:

```ts
const divisible = element => element % this?.divisor === 0;

const isThereEvenNumber = numbers.some(divisible, { divisor: 2 });
const isThereAnyDivisibleByThree = numbers.some(divisible, { divisor: 3 });
const isThereAnyDivisibleBySeven = numbers.some(divisible, { divisor: 7 });

console.log(isThereEvenNumber); // false
console.log(isThereAnyDivisibleByThree); // false
console.log(isThereAnyDivisibleBySeven); // false
```

All returning `false`, although we expect two to be `true` and one to be `false`.

If we investigate the problem with a modified `divisible()` function that logs `this` to the console, we see that `this` is `undefined` in strict mode:

```ts
// strict mode

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const divisible = element => {
  console.log(this);
  return element % this?.divisor === 0;
};

const isThereEvenNumber = numbers.some(divisible, { divisor: 2 });

console.log(isThereEvenNumber);
// undefined
// undefined
// undefined
// undefined
// undefined
// false
```

Now, if we introduce a `this.divisor` property to the lexical environment of `divisible()`, we get its value logged to the console:

```ts
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
this.divisor = 'Hi';

const divisible = element => {
  console.log(this);
  return element % this.divisor === 0;
};

const isThereEvenNumber = numbers.some(divisible, { divisor: 2 });

console.log(isThereEvenNumber);
// { divisor: 'Hi' }
// { divisor: 'Hi' }
// { divisor: 'Hi' }
// { divisor: 'Hi' }
// { divisor: 'Hi' }
// false
```

Here, clearly, we have `{ divisor: 'Hi' }` coming from `divisible()`'s closure. It turns out, the problem is due to the binding of `divisible()`'s `this` to it's lexical environment because of the arrow syntax. It was `undefined` before we introduced `this.divisor = 'Hi';`. Now `this` is `{ divisor: 'Hi' }`. In other words, `{ divisor: 2 `} is not being relayed to `divisible`'s `this`.

So, `some()` with `thisArg` does not work as expected with `callbackFn` defined with arrow syntax.



## `some(callback, thisArg)` Works With Non-Arrow Functions

But as we have seen before, it works with callbacks defined with named function declarations:

```ts
function divisible(element) {
  return element % this?.divisor === 0;
};

const isThereEvenNumber = numbers.some(divisible, { divisor: 2 });

console.log(isThereEvenNumber); // true
```

It also works with anonymous function expressions:

```ts
const divisible = function(element) {
  return element % this?.divisor === 0;
};

const isThereEvenNumber = numbers.some(divisible, { divisor: 2 });

console.log(isThereEvenNumber); // true
```

## Modifying the Caller Array

**JavaScript some method** sets the range of the items to be processed before the first invocation of the callback function.

`some()` itself does not modify the caller array, but the caller is available to the callback function as its third argument, `array`. And if an item is changed after traversal, the change is disregarded by the callback function. That is, the callback function only respects the existing value of an item at the time it is visited.

We can witness this in a scenario where the caller array is mutated from inside `some()`.

JavaScript `some()` itself does not modify the caller array, but the caller is available to the callback function as its third argument, `array`. This means we can deliberately mutate the caller when we need to from inside our callback, `divisible()`:

```ts
function divisible(element, index, array) {
  array[0] = 7;
  array[4] = 7;
  console.log(array);
  return element % this?.divisor === 0;
};
```

In this scenario, if an unvisited item is changed ahead of time, the callback function - here `divisible()` - finds the new value when it visits the item and so the new value is processed. In contrast, it disregards changes to items that are already traversed:

```ts
const divisible = function(element, index, array) {
  array[0] = 7;
  array[4] = 7;

  console.log(array);

  return element % this?.divisor === 0;
};

const isDivisibleBySeven = numbers.some(divisible, { divisor: 7 });

console.log(isDivisibleBySeven);
console.log(numbers);
/*
  [ 7, 2, 3, 4, 7 ]
  [ 7, 2, 3, 4, 7 ]
  [ 7, 2, 3, 4, 7 ]
  [ 7, 2, 3, 4, 7 ]
  [ 7, 2, 3, 4, 7 ]
  true
  [ 7, 2, 3, 4, 7 ]
*/
```
In the console log statements above, the `numbers` array is being logged five times due to the `console.log(array);` statement we placed inside `divisible()`.

As we can see, `numbers` is being mutated twice in the first call to `divisible()`. The first mutation happens when at `numbers[0]`, i.e. after being visited, which changes the value of itself to `7`. So, even though it was divisible by the divisor `7`, `some()` didn't immediately return `true`. Instead, it returned `true` in the next instance when it visited the unvisited and mutated value of `7` at `numbers[4]`.

This shows that the callback function processes the value of an item as it finds it at traversal and disregards the changes made to it when and after it is at that index.




## Conclusion

In this article, we focused on **JavaScript some** method which helps us test whether an array has at least one item that passes the test we implement using a callback function. We saw that the callback function could take only three arguments, and additional arguments can be bound to its execution context by setting its `this` value with a `thisArg` passed to `some()`.

We also found out that if we use arrow syntax to declare the callback function, its lexical context binding messes with the binding of `thisArg` to its `this` object. So, we should be using non-arrow functions to declare a callback function that uses `this`.
