## Introduction

Programmers and software engineers spend a significant proportion of their time using IDEs and text editors for writing code. Most IDEs and text editors, such as VS Code, Sublime Text, and Notepad++, are desktop applications. However, there are also several online editors that you can use for building, testing, prototyping, and showcasing simple hobby projects, especially in web development.

This article will introduce you to some of the most popular free online Editors and IDEs, such as CodeSandbox, Codepen, JSFiddle,  StackBlitz, Glitch, and Repl.it. You can use some of these online IDEs and text editors to build simple front-end applications, while others, like Glitch, are for both front-end and full-stack applications.

Your choice of an online IDE largely depends on whether you want to build a front-end, back-end, or full-stack application. We will explore the pros and cons of these IDEs and text editors.

It is worth pointing out that this article will explore the main features of the most popular online editors and IDEs. It will not identify which editor is the best. We will also go above and beyond to explore the strengths and weaknesses of each editor so that you can choose one which meets your needs.

Steps we will cover:

- [Bootstrapping a project for demonstration](#bootstrapping-a-project-for-demonstration)
- [Top free online Editors and IDEs with free plans for hobby projects](#top-free-online-editors-and-ides-with-free-plans-for-hobby-projects)
- [Comparing top online Editors and IDEs](#comparing-top-online-editors-and-ides)

## Bootstrapping a project for demonstration

It is possible to import a project from your local machine or Git hosting service like GitHub to some online text editors or IDEs. Therefore, we will create a basic **[refine](https://github.com/Thecosy/IceCMS)** application in this section. We will use this application for illustration.

[refine](https://github.com/Thecosy/IceCMS) is a React-based framework for developing web applications. It is useful when developing data-intensive CRUD applications such as admin panels and dashboards. Follow the steps below to bootstrap a simple refine application using [superplate](https://github.com/pankod/superplate).

### How to create refine application

The easiest way to start using Refine is to bootstrap an application using [superplate](https://github.com/pankod/superplate).  
Run the command below on the terminal.

```sh
npx superplate-cli example-project --project refine-react
```

Successfully running the command above will create a `refine-react` project in the `example-project` directory. You must respond to the command line prompts. You can also choose the default options throughout if you wish.

After successfully creating the Refine project, navigate to the `example-project` project directory using the command below.

```sh
cd example-project
```


To be sure the project you created is working, use the command below to launch the development server.

```sh
npm run dev
```

The above command will launch the development server on localhost. You can host the project on GitHub to import it to some of the online editors we will explore in the sections below.

## Top free online Editors and IDEs with free plans for hobby projects

You will explore the most popular online editors and IDE's with generous free plans in this section. The focus will be more on editors and IDE's like **Codepen**, **CodeSandbox**, **StackBlitz**, and **JsFiddle**, primarily for building front-end projects, but we will also explore others like **Repl.it** and **Glitch**.

We will go above and beyond to highlight the pros and cons of online text editors and IDE's.

## Codepen

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/) is one of the most popular online text editors for building, testing, showcasing and discovering simple front-end projects built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### How to open a GitHub repository in StackBlitz?

Instead of using the starter projects to create a new project on StackBlitz, you can import a GitHub repository. Follow the steps below to import the example project we created above.

### Deploy the example project to GitHub

Host the **refine** example project we created on GitHub. You can also use one of the [tutorial examples](https://github.com/Thecosy/IceCMS/tree/master/examples/tutorial) if you don't want to deploy the example project.

### How to open a public GitHub repository in StackBlitz?

You can open a public GitHub repository in StackBlitz by adding the GitHub username and the repository name like so:

```txt
https://www.stackblitz.com/github/{GITHUB_USERNAME}/{REPOSITORY_NAME}/{BRANCH|TAG|COMMIT}
```

You can also specify the script in your `package.json` file StackBlitz will use to set up the development serve as a query string. In the example below, StackBlitz will use the `dev` script.

```txt
https://www.stackblitz.com/github/refinedev/refine/tree/master/examples/tutorial-antd?view=preview&theme=dark&codemirror=1
```

You can open one of the tutorial examples in StackBlitz by following [this link](https://www.stackblitz.com/github/refinedev/refine/tree/master/examples/tutorial-antd?view=preview&theme=dark&codemirror=1).

## CodeSandbox

[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) is another online editor for building front-end and full-stack web apps. It is handy for quickly prototyping, showcasing, and experimenting with new ideas and projects. You can also embed a sandbox in blog posts, documentation, and GitHub project READMEs.

Like StackBlitz, CodeSandbox has several starter templates to choose from when launching a new sandbox. It supports the most popular front-end frameworks like React, Vue, Gatsby, and Next.

To start using CodeSandbox, you can sign in using your GitHub, Google, or Apple account. You can create a new sandbox using one of the built-in starter templates or create a sandbox by importing a project from your local machine or a GitHub repository.

#### How to upload a project from local computer to CodeSandbox?

CodeSandbox has a command line tool for uploading a project from your local machine to CodeSandbox.  Follow the steps below to use it for deploying the example project you created above.

####  Install the `codesandbox` command line tool

To upload a sandbox using a project in your local machine, install the `codesandbox` command line tool by running the command below on the terminal.

```sh
npm install --global codesandbox
```

The command above will install the `codesandbox` command line tool globally. To check if the installation was successful, run the command below on the terminal. It should display the version of the `codesandbox` command line tool.

```sh
codesandbox -V
```

####  Log into your CodeSandbox account from the command line

After successfully installing the command line tool described in the previous step, log into your CodeSandbox account using the `codesandbox` command line tool. Run the command below on the terminal.

```sh
codesandbox login
```

You need to respond to the command prompts after running the command above. The command line tool will open your default browser. After login, CodeSandbox will generate an authentication token. You will use the generated token to log into CodeSandbox from the command line.

####  Upload the project from local machine to CodeSandbox

After successfully installing the command line tool and logging into CodeSandbox as described in the previous sections, use the command below to upload the current directory to a sandbox. If you want to deploy a different directory, replace `./` with the path to the directory.

```sh
codesandbox deploy ./
```

#### How to import a GitHub repository to CodeSandbox?

Instead of importing a project to CodeSandbox from your local machine, it is also possible to import a GitHub repository. In the steps below, we will import the Refine example project we created to CodeSandbox from GitHub. Create a GitHub account if you haven't. You should also host the example project in a GitHub repository before following the steps below.

####  Log into your CodeSandbox account in the browser

You must first log into your CodeSandbox account. As pointed out above, you can log into CodeSandbox using your GitHub, Google, or Apple account.

####  Grant CodeSandbox access to your GitHub account

After logging into your CodeSandbox account, grant CodeSandbox access to your GitHub account. Click the button with three dots on the top right. In the drop-down menu, click Preferences and then Integrations. After that, sign into your GitHub account.
