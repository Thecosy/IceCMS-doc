## Technologies Used

Our CRM app's modular structure and use of open-source tools make it adaptable to various business needs. So you can build all kinds of web apps like internal tools, admin panels, or dashboards on top of it.

To bring our CRM app to life, we leveraged several cutting-edge technologies:

### 1. refine

[refine](https://github.com/Thecosy/IceCMS) served as the backbone of our CRM application. It offers a wide range of tools and components for easily building data-intensive applications.

refine's internal hooks and components simplify the development process and eliminate repetitive tasks by providing industry-standard solutions for crucial aspects of a project, including authentication, access control, routing, networking, state management, and i18n.

### 2. Ant Design

[Ant Design](https://ant.design/), a popular UI library, provided the sleek and responsive user interface that our CRM app needed. Its pre-built components saved us time and effort.

It's consistent and polished UI components ensured a professional and user-friendly interface. refine has a built-in integration for Ant Design.

### 3. GraphQL

We used [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) for effective data retrieval and updating from our server. Additionally, we integrated [GraphQL Subscriptions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/) to manage real-time modifications.

For instance, on the Project Kanban page, tasks get updated automatically when cards are dragged and dropped between sections.

GraphQL's efficient data-fetching capabilities made working with large datasets a breeze. It's flexibility allowed us to tailor our queries to our exact requirements.

refine has built-in data provider support for GraphQL.You can set it up during the project creation phase.

## Best Practices and Ecosystem Integration

Throughout the development process, we adhered to best practices and incorporated elements from the broader ecosystem. This ensures our CRM app is not only functional but also scalable and maintainable.

The group responsible for the CRM example app is the core refine framework team. Feel free to explore the best practices within the ecosystem!
