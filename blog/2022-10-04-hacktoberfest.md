## refine :heart: Hacktoberfest

This year, for the first time, refine is excited to participate in Hacktoberfest! If you're not familiar with it, Hacktoberfest is a month-long event that encourages developers from all backgrounds to contribute to open source projects. It's a great opportunity for beginners to get started in coding and for experienced developers to share their knowledge. If you're interested in participating, check out the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com) website for more information.

  
We've already labeled a bunch of **refine** issues with `hacktoberfest` so you can start hunting right away. The list includes easy ones to get familiar with **refine**, but we've also got more difficult ones for experienced developers:

Participating is not only fun, but you can also win prizes by taking part. If one of your PR's is merged to core framework, you'll be rewarded with a stylish  [refine t-shirt ](https://store.refine.dev/product/develop-tshirt).  In case you've got 2+ PR's merged, we'll send you a complete refine SWAG Kit, incl.[t-shirt, cap & bottle](https://store.refine.dev/)

Happy coding to everyone!
