With 2022, a new future in our careers as software developers. We will meet new technologies this year and continue to pursue innovations as before.

<!--truncate-->

### Production Oriented Approach ðŸ§° 

`{ Production }`

Developing is often a real challenge. It is necessary to follow the innovations and use all these in the right place at the right time and again in the right way. Sometimes all these prevent us from producing or slow down our production process. It is our responsibility to ensure that technology serves us in a development environment where we prioritize production.

### Is speed everything?

So is speed exactly everything?

3 main components affect production in traditional production methods.

Speed ðŸ’¨
QualityðŸ‘Œ 
Time âŒ›

Can you imagine what a development environment would be like where we provided all 3 components at the same time?

### Briefly Refine

A React-based <u>headless</u> framework for building internal tools, rapidly.

#### What gives us Refine?

The word headless is underlined above. So Refine drop you into UI heaven, meanwhile, you can also use Antd library support.

Yes, of course.Both for React and Next.

#### Realtime

Realtime support to your app via liveProvider, there's even an [example](https://refine.dev/docs/examples/live-provider/ably/) made for you with Ably.


### What makes Refine Unique?

Refine stands out with its wide _**routing**_, **_access control_** options, supporting the ability to use _**any UI Framework**_ and **_NextJS SSR_** support when compared to  React Admin, retool, adminBro.

### Look at your productivity without worrying about is everything on the way
