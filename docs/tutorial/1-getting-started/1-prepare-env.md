## Get the dev tools you need

Before you can create a Refine app, you need to set up a development environment on your local machine. This includes installing a few tools that you will use to create your project, and run key commands to build, develop, and test your site.

### Terminal

You will use a terminal (also known as a command line interface) to run commands and interact with your operating system. You can access the terminal through a local program of your operating system, such as Terminal (MacOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows).

In order to run Refine applications on your system, you will also need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is required to run Refine applications because it is a JavaScript-based tool.

To check if you already have a compatible version of Node.js (v.16.0.0 or higher) installed:

1. Launch your terminal and type the following command:

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

2. If you do not have a compatible version of Node.js installed, follow these instructions to [install Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) via the terminal.

### Code Editor

In addition to a terminal, you will also need a code editor to write and edit your code. A code editor is a software application that allows you to write and edit code for various programming languages.

:::info

This tutorial will use **VS Code**, but you can use any code editor that is compatible with your operating system. Some other popular code editors include **Sublime Text**, **Atom** and **Eclipse**.
