# 2. Create a data provider with `swizzle`

## What is swizzle?

In some cases, **Refine's** built-in data providers may not fully meet your API needs, and you may want to edit the existing data provider logic. If that is the case, you should use `swizzle`.

The [`swizzle`](/docs/packages/list-of-packages/#swizzle) is a command in [`refine-cli`](/docs/packages/list-of-packages) that allows you to customize **Refine’s** supported components and data providers by letting you eject selected files from the Refine packages and modify them depending on your needs.

This also allows you to use the ejected file code logic as a starting point for your modifications instead of starting from scratch.

## How do you use swizzle to create an data provider?

1. Run the `swizzle` command in the project directory:

   ```bash
   npm run refine swizzle
   ```

2. Select the data provider package of your choice from the list. We are using `@refinedev/simple-rest` in this tutorial so we will choose that.

   ```bash
   ? Which package do you want to swizzle?
     Data Provider
   ❯  @refinedev/simple-rest
     UI Framework
     @refinedev/antd
   ```

   `swizzle` will copy the necessary files for this package to the `src/rest-data-provider` folder

   ```bash
   Successfully swizzled Data Provider

   Files created:
   - src/rest-data-provider/index.ts
   - src/rest-data-provider/utils/axios.ts
   - src/rest-data-provider/utils/generateFilter.ts
   - src/rest-data-provider/utils/generateSort.ts
   - src/rest-data-provider/utils/mapOperator.ts
   - src/rest-data-provider/utils/index.ts

   Warning:
   You will also need to add axios to your project dependencies.

   Usage

     │   import { dataProvider } from "./rest-data-provider";   │
     │                                                          │

     │       return (                                           │
     │           <Refine                                        │
     │               dataProvider={dataProvider}                │
     │               /* ... */                                  │
     │           />                                             │
     │       );                                                 │
     │   }                                                      │
     │                                                          │
     ╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
   ```

3. To use the generated data provider, we need to import it in the `App.tsx` file and give it as a `dataProvider` prop to the `Refine` component.

And with that, you are now able to modify and use the ejected data provider however you want. Amount of time saved using `swizzle` instead of creating a data provider from scratch is quite substantial.
