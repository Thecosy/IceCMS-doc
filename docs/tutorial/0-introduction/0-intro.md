Since Refine is a meta framework designed for building all types of CRUD apps, such as _internal tools_, _admin panels_, _B2B apps_, and _dashboards_, this tutorial will focus on showcasing how Refine simplifies the development process of creating a minimal yet fully functional admin panel app.

You will be guided through the process of building a CRUD app, including authentication, CRUD operation components, and fully functional pages, all built using the Refine framework

You can take a look at the similar app that we'll be constructing in this tutorial by following this [link](https://refine.new/preview/a4f6eb83-2dd7-453b-b26a-4d3f48eeb543).

**We'll cover the following topics:**

- Setting up your development environment.
- Creating your first Refine app.
- Communicate with your API through [`dataProvider`](/docs/data/data-provider).
- The concept of the [`resources`](/docs/core/refine-component#resources) property.
- Adding CRUD pages to your project.
- Handle authentication with [`authProvider`](/docs/tutorial/understanding-authprovider/index/).

You will learn all the necessary steps to get started with Refine, from setting up your development environment to launching your app. üöÄ
