## Adding Delete Feature to List Page

`<DeleteButton/>` is a Refine component that is used for deleting records. When you click on the delete button, it will show a confirmation modal and delete the record upon confirmation. To add it to the "blog_posts" table:

1.  Open the `src/pages/blog-posts/list.tsx` file on your editor.

2.  Import the `<DeleteButton/>` component from `@refinedev/antd`:

    ```tsx
    import { DeleteButton } from "@refinedev/antd";
    ```

3.  Add the `<DeleteButton/>` component to the `actions` column of the table:

    ```tsx
    <Table.Column
      title="Actions"
      dataIndex="actions"
      render={(_, record: BaseRecord) => (
        <Space>
          <EditButton hideText size="small" recordItemId={record.id} />
          <ShowButton hideText size="small" recordItemId={record.id} />
          //highlight-start
          <DeleteButton hideText size="small" recordItemId={record.id} />
          //highlight-end
        </Space>
      )}
    />
    ```

You can now delete a record from the list page by clicking on the delete button of any blog post.

## Enabling the Delete Feature on Show and Edit Pages

We can enable the delete feature on both show and edit pages while we are defining a resource by setting the `canDelete` property in the `meta` to `true` as shown below:

```tsx src="src/App.tsx"
import { Refine } from "@refinedev/core";
import { Layout, notificationProvider, ErrorComponent } from "@refinedev/antd";
import routerBindings, { UnsavedChangesNotifier } from "@refinedev/react-router-v6";
import dataProvider from "@refinedev/simple-rest";

import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

import { BlogPostList } from "pages/blog-posts/list";
import { BlogPostEdit } from "pages/blog-posts/edit";
import { BlogPostshow } from "pages/blog-posts/show";
import { BlogPostCreate } from "pages/blog-posts/create";

import "@refinedev/antd/dist/reset.css";

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Refine
        routerProvider={routerBindings}
        dataProvider={dataProvider("https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev")}
        notificationProvider={notificationProvider}
        resources={[
          {
            name: "blog_posts",
            // highlight-start
            meta: {
              canDelete: true,
            },
            // highlight-end
          },
        ]}
        options={{
          syncWithLocation: true,
          warnWhenUnsavedChanges: true,
        }}
      >
        {/* ... */}
        <UnsavedChangesNotifier />
      </Refine>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};
export default App;
```

After setting the `canDelete` property in `meta` to `true`, you will see a delete button on both show and edit pages.

> For more information, refer to the [`canDelete` section of the `<Refine/>` documentation&#8594](/docs/core/refine-component#candelete)

:::tip

You can also use `useDelete` hook provided by Refine to delete a record.
