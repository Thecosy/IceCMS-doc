## Adding Delete Feature to List Page

`<DeleteButton/>` is a Refine component that is used for deleting records. When you click on the delete button, it will show a confirmation modal and delete the record upon confirmation. To add it to the "blog_posts" table:

1.  Open the `src/pages/blog-posts/list.tsx` file on your editor.

2.  Import the `<DeleteButton/>` component from `@refinedev/antd`:

    ```tsx
    import { DeleteButton } from "@refinedev/chakra-ui";
    ```

3.  Add the `<DeleteButton/>` component to the `actions` column of the table:

    ```tsx
    {
        id: "actions",
        accessorKey: "id",
        header: "Actions",
        cell: function render({ getValue }) {
            return (
                <HStack>
                    <ShowButton
                        hideText
                        recordItemId={getValue() as string}
                    />
                    <EditButton
                        hideText
                        recordItemId={getValue() as string}
                    />
                    //highlight-start
                    <DeleteButton
                        hideText
                        recordItemId={getValue() as string}
                    />
                    //highlight-end
                </HStack>
            );
        },
    },
    ```

You can now delete a record from the list page by clicking on the delete button of any blog post.

## Enabling the Delete Feature on Show and Edit Pages

We can enable the delete feature on both show and edit pages while we are defining a resource by setting the `canDelete` property in the `meta` to `true` as shown below:

```tsx src="src/App.tsx"
import { Refine } from "@refinedev/core";
import routerBindings, { UnsavedChangesNotifier } from "@refinedev/react-router-v6";
import dataProvider from "@refinedev/simple-rest";
import { ErrorComponent, Layout, refineTheme, notificationProvider } from "@refinedev/chakra-ui";
import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/react";

import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

import { BlogPostList } from "pages/blog-posts/list";
import { BlogPostEdit } from "pages/blog-posts/edit";
import { BlogPostShow } from "pages/blog-posts/show";
import { BlogPostCreate } from "pages/blog-posts/create";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider theme={refineTheme}>
      <BrowserRouter>
        <Refine
          routerProvider={routerBindings}
          dataProvider={dataProvider("https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev")}
          notificationProvider={notificationProvider}
          resources={[
            {
              name: "blog_posts",
              // highlight-start
              meta: {
                canDelete: true,
              },
              // highlight-end
            },
          ]}
          options={{
            syncWithLocation: true,
            warnWhenUnsavedChanges: true,
          }}
        >
          {/* ... */}
          <UnsavedChangesNotifier />
        </Refine>
      </BrowserRouter>
    </ChakraProvider>
  );
};
export default App;
```

After setting the `canDelete` property in `meta` to `true`, you will see a delete button on both show and edit pages.

> For more information, refer to the [`canDelete` section of the `<Refine/>` documentation&#8594](/docs/core/refine-component#candelete)

You can also use `useDelete` hook provided by Refine to delete a record.
