`useDelete` is a Refine hook that is used to delete a record. It returns mutation functions that can be used to delete a record, and when the mutation function is called, the parameters of the function are passed to the `delete` method of the data provider.

We will now add a delete button to the list page by using the `useDelete` hook; for this, follow these steps:

1. Open the `src/pages/blog-posts/list.tsx` file on your editor.

2. Import the `useOne` hook from `@refinedev/core`:

   ```tsx
   import { useOne } from "@refinedev/core";
   ```

3. Call the `useDelete` hook in the `BlogPostList` component:

   ```tsx
   const BlogPostList: React.FC = () => {
     const { mutate: deleteBlogPost } = useDelete();
   };
   ```

   > You can check the parameters of the `deleteBlogPost` mutation function in the [`useDelete` documentation](/docs/data/hooks/use-delete#properties).

4. Add the `<button/>` component to the `actions` column of the table as shown below:

   ```tsx
   {
               id: "actions",
               accessorKey: "id",
               header: "Actions",
               cell: function render({ getValue }) {
                   return (
                       <div
                           style={{
                               display: "flex",
                               flexDirection: "row",
                               flexWrap: "wrap",
                               gap: "4px",
                           }}
                       >
                           <button
                               onClick={() => {
                                   show("blog_posts", getValue() as string);
                               }}
                           >
                               Show
                           </button>
                           <button
                               onClick={() => {
                                   edit("blog_posts", getValue() as string);
                               }}
                           >
                               Edit
                           </button>
                           //highlight-start
                           <button
                               onClick={() => {
                                   deleteBlogPost({
                                       resource: "blog_posts",
                                       id: getValue() as string,
                                   });
                               }}
                           >
                               Delete
                           </button>
                           //highlight-end
                       </div>
                   );
               },
           },
   ```

You can now delete a record from the list page by clicking on the delete button of any blog post.
