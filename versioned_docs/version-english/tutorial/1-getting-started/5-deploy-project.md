To make your app accessible to the public, you can use a hosting service to build and deploy your site live on the web. In this tutorial, we will use Netlify, but you are welcome to choose your preferred hosting service.

Netlify will use your GitHub repository to build and deploy your site every time you commit a change to your code. To connect your repository to Netlify, you will need to create a new Netlify site and link it to your GitHub repository.
