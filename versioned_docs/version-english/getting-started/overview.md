## Project Overview

IceCMS Uniapp Mini Program/H5/APP version is a social forum Q&amp;A posting/BBS content management project based on a front-end and back-end separation architecture.

The project consists of the Uniapp user client (compatible with H5, WeChat Mini Program, and APP), the Vue-based admin panel (which includes complete RBAC permission handling and web pages), and the Java-based back-end.

It is developed using the following technology stack: **SpringBoot2, MybatisPlus, Shiro, JWT, Redis, Vue, Uniapp, and MySQL5.7** .

The project is available in both Open Source and Standard versions, and this documentation is for the Standard version, though parts of it are applicable to the Open Source version as well.
