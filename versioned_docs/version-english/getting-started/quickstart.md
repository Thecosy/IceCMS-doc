**refine** works on any environment you can run **React** (incl. *CRA, Next.js, Remix, Vite* etc.)


Although you could take the time to manually set up your environment and install **refine** packages afterwards, the smart way to get started with **refine** is using the project starter tool. 

`create refine-app` provides built-in templates for *CRA*, *Next.js* and *Remix* environments so you can bootstrap a **refine** project in a couple of minutes. It also offers a wide range of options that you can automatically configure for your *UI framework*, *i18n*, *router*, *Auth.* and *data provider* settings.

To get started, please run the following command. The **CLI wizard** will assist you for the rest of the setup process:

```
npm create refine-app@latest my-project
```

It will create your **refine** project and install the required packages according to your selections. After completing the setup, navigate to the project folder and start your application with:

```
npm run dev
```

<br/>


You can now view **refine** application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):


## Quick Start Example

We will show how you can use the CLI to bootstrap a **refine** app with [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). You can also use [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) as well.

```
npm create refine-app@latest  my-antd-project
```

<br/>

Select the following options to complete CLI wizard:

```
? Select your project type: 
‚ùØ refine-react

? Do you want to use a UI Framework?:
‚ùØ Ant Design

? Do you want a customized theme?:
‚ùØ Default theme

? Router Provider:
‚ùØ React Router v6

? Data Provider:
‚ùØ REST API

? Auth Provider:
‚ùØ None

? Do you want to add example pages? 
‚ùØ Yes

? Do you want a customized layout?
‚ùØ No
```


:::info
 We only show important options for this example. You can prefer to select other options like [Kbar](https://github.com/timc1/kbar) and [i18n](https://www.i18next.com/). Different options selections may be result in a different project structure.

<br/>

Once the setup is complete, navigate to the project folder and start your project with:

```
npm run dev
```


<br/>



You can now view **refine** application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see the output as a table populated with `post` & `category` data with filter, sort, and pagination features


<div >
   <img style={{width: "100%"}} src="https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/website/static/img/first-example-result.png" alt="Example result" />
</div>

<br />



:::tip
Since we selected the `Do you want to add example pages?` option as `Yes` during the CLI project creation phase, refine adds example CRUD pages and the `resources` to the app. You can navigate to the example pages and try out the CRUD operations features.

We always recommend to add example pages to your project to get a better understanding of how **refine** works.
